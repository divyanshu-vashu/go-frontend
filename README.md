# React Frontend Project

## Overview

This is the frontend application for a project that interacts with a Go backend. The frontend is built using React and handles user interactions, authentication, and other UI functionalities.

## Backend

The backend for this project is implemented using Go and can be found at [Go Backend Repository](https://github.com/divyanshu-vashu/go-backend). Ensure the backend is set up and running before starting the frontend application.

## Installation

To get started with the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/divyanshu-vashu/go-frontend.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd go-frontend
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) installed. Then, run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or if you prefer Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   or with Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Configuration

The application requires certain environment variables to function correctly. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and configure it as follows:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
# Add other environment variables as needed
```

Replace `http://localhost:8080` with the URL of your backend server if it differs.

## Running Tests

To run the unit tests for the project, use:

```bash
npm test
```

or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn test
```

## Building for Production

To create a production build of the application, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will create a `build` directory with the production-ready files.
